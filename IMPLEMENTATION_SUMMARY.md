# Point-to-Point Navigation Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented a comprehensive point-to-point navigation system for the CARLA RL environment. This system allows the agent to learn to drive from one point to another along a route of waypoints.

## Files Created

1. **carla_env/navigation.py**: Core navigation classes
   - `Waypoint`: Class to represent points in the world
   - `RouteManager`: Class to manage routes, track waypoints, and provide navigation guidance

2. **navigation_example.py**: Standalone example demonstrating the navigation system
   - A simple rule-based policy that follows waypoints
   - Demonstrates how to access navigation information

3. **NAVIGATION_README.md**: Documentation for the navigation system

4. **utils/visualization.py**: Camera visualization utility
   - `CameraViewer` class for displaying the agent's camera input in a separate window
   - Thread-safe implementation with frame queue for real-time display

5. **view_camera.py**: Standalone script for visualizing camera input
   - Simple script to view what the agent "sees" in real-time
   - Supports custom resolution and frame rate

## Files Modified

1. **config.py**: Added navigation configuration parameters
   - `NAVIGATION_ENABLED`: Flag to enable/disable navigation
   - `WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD`: Distance to consider a waypoint reached
   - `WAYPOINT_DIRECTION_WEIGHT`: Weight for directional reward
   - `WAYPOINT_DISTANCE_WEIGHT`: Weight for distance-based reward
   - `ROUTE_DIFFICULTY`: Difficulty level for routes
   - `DIFFICULTY_PROGRESSION`: Progression thresholds

2. **carla_env/carla_client.py**: Updated to support navigation
   - Added navigation attributes: route_manager, etc.
   - Implemented route visualization
   - Added methods to update navigation and provide info
   - Modified vehicle spawning to initialize routes
   - Updated spectator camera to follow the vehicle

3. **carla_env/rl_env.py**: Enhanced for navigation
   - Added navigation parameters
   - Enhanced reward function with navigation rewards
   - Updated termination conditions
   - Added methods to update navigation difficulty
   - Enhanced environment info with navigation data

4. **main.py**: Added command-line arguments for navigation and visualization
   - Added `--navigation`, `--route_difficulty`, etc.
   - Added `--show_camera`, `--camera_width`, `--camera_height`
   - Updated environment creation to pass navigation parameters
   - Added camera visualization integration

## Key Features

### 1. Progressive Difficulty

The system starts with easy routes (few, closely spaced waypoints) and progressively increases difficulty as training progresses. This helps the agent learn incrementally, starting from simple tasks and building up to more complex navigation.

### 2. Visual Feedback

The waypoints are visualized in the simulator with color coding:
- Green: Current target
- Blue: Future targets
- Red: Completed targets

This provides immediate visual feedback on the agent's progress.

### 3. Enhanced Rewards

The reward function has been enhanced with several navigation-specific components:
- Target reached bonus
- Direction-based reward
- Distance improvement reward
- Route completion reward

### 4. Camera Visualization

The camera visualization feature allows you to see what the agent "sees" in real-time:
- Displays the camera input used by the agent in a separate window
- Thread-safe implementation with proper synchronization
- Configurable resolution and frame rate
- Works during both training and evaluation

### 5. Flexible Configuration

The navigation system can be easily configured through command-line arguments:
- Enable/disable with `--navigation`
- Set difficulty with `--route_difficulty`
- Visualize route with `--visualize_route`
- Set waypoint threshold with `--waypoint_threshold`
- Enable camera view with `--show_camera`
- Set camera resolution with `--camera_width` and `--camera_height`

## How to Use

### Running the Navigation Example

```bash
python navigation_example.py
```

### Training with Navigation

```bash
python main.py --algorithm dqn --train --navigation --episodes 1000 --route_difficulty easy
```

### Evaluating with Navigation

```bash
python main.py --algorithm dqn --eval --navigation --load_checkpoint models/your_checkpoint.pth
```

### Visualizing the Camera Input

```bash
# View camera input with a standalone script
python view_camera.py

# Enable camera visualization during training
python main.py --algorithm dqn --train --navigation --show_camera
```

The navigation system is ideal for gradually teaching an RL agent to drive to specific destinations, starting with easy tasks and progressively increasing complexity.
